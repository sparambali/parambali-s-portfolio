# [Project 1: Laptop price predictor](https://github.com/sparambali/laptop-price-predictor)

* This is a project where I build model to predict the price of the different laptop based on different features like RAM, ips panel,storage size, touch screen, processor etc

* The model uses  ridge,lasso regularisation technique to overcome overfit and underfit

* Algorithm used: Decision tree regressor, Random forest regressor, extra tree, KNeighborsRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor etc 

* I used python to bulid this model


# [Project 2: Movie Recommendation system](https://github.com/sparambali/movie-recommending-system)

* This is a project where I build a recommendation system for  movie dataset

* Data was taken from tmdb-database

* The model uses both; content based filtering techniques and collobrative filtering technique

* Algorithm used: Regularisation,K-nearest neighbour,singular value decomposition

* I  used python languge to visualise the dataset and build the model

# [Project 3 : Recommending customer to premium insurance](https://github.com/sparambali/capstone-project1)

* Dataset was taken from  kaggle

* The main idea behind this project is to showcase the potential clients for the company

* I used several tools to identify potential clients. We  used tools like excel, python to identify the potential clients and to identify the opportunities for growth for the insurance company.

* I used python to answer the number of questions and to analyse the dataset.
