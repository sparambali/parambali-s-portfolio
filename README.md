# [Project 1: Laptop price predictor](https://github.com/sparambali/laptop-price-predictor)

* This is a project where I build model to predict the price of the different laptop based on different features like RAM, ips panel,storage size, touch screen, processor etc

* The model uses  ridge,lasso regularisation technique to overcome overfit and underfit

* Algorithm used: Decision tree regressor, Random forest regressor, extra tree, KNeighborsRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor etc 

* I used python to bulid this model

# [Project 2: Movie Recommendation system](https://github.com/sparambali/Tensorflow-embedding-to-convert-text-column-into-numerical)

* In this project I have used titanic dataset which I downloaded from Kaggle.

* This project focuses on the tensorflow Embeddings API. This API allows users to extract vector representations, also known as embeddings, from textual column(family_size,Embarked,sex) of titanic dataset.

* I performed some feature engineering and feature extraction method where i removed and created some more column/feature which are used for better model prediction.

* In this project I used tensorflow embedding to convert textual columns(family_size,Embarked,sex) into 3D vector space which is used for model prediction.

* Finally, I am using logistic regression and decision tree classifier to predict the model

# [Project 3: Movie Recommendation system](https://github.com/sparambali/movie-recommending-system)

* This is a project where I build a recommendation system for  movie dataset

* Data was taken from tmdb-database

* The model uses both; content based filtering techniques and collobrative filtering technique

* Algorithm used: Regularisation,K-nearest neighbour,singular value decomposition

* I  used python languge to visualise the dataset and build the model

# [Project 4 : Recommending customer to premium insurance](https://github.com/sparambali/capstone-project1)

* Dataset was taken from  kaggle

* The main idea behind this project is to showcase the potential clients for the company

* I used several tools to identify potential clients. We  used tools like excel, python to identify the potential clients and to identify the opportunities for growth for the insurance company.

* I used Power Bi  for visualisation to analyse the datase and  python to answer the number of questions and for prediction.
