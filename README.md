# [project 1:movie Recommendation system](https://github.com/sparambali/movie-recommending-system)

This is a project where I build a recommendation system for a movie dataset

*Data was taken from tmdb-database

*The model uses both; content based filtering techniques and collobrative filtering technique

*Algorithm used: Regularisation,K-nearest neighbour,singular value decomposition

*I  used python languge to visualise the dataset and build the model


# [project 2:recommoding customer to premium insurance](https://github.com/sparambali/capstone-project1)

*dataset was taken from kaggle

*The main idea behind this project is to showcase the potential clients for the company

*I used several tools to identify potential clients. We  used tools like excel, python to identify the potential clients and to identify the opportunities for growth for the insurance company.

* I used python to answer the number of questions and to analyse the dataset.

# [project 3: loptop price predictor](https://github.com/sparambali/laptop-price-predictor)

*This is a project where i build model which predict the price of the different laptop

*The model uses  ridge,lasso regularisation technique to overcome overfit and underfit

*algorithm used: decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, extra tree,svr

* I used python to bulid this model

# Personal roadmap
 # Background
 I have done my bachelors in Electronics and telecommunication Engineering. I choose this field because since my childhood I was surrounded by transistor, capacitor and many other electronics devices. I am very fascinated with electronics devices at that time. After my engineering I worked in IT company namley Acer computers. In this company I got to know about data . I become aware how much data is useful for the organisation to operate  in decision making and become successful.I think in future, there will be data revolution as third revolution like first first revolution and second revolution .
# current state
Currently, I am pursing graduate certificate course in DURHAM college ON. The first semester is about to end.In the first semester, we had six different courses, which made us to learn and use the tools which are taught comprehensively. Some of those were tabluea, power BI , R, Pyhton, my sql, github etc. Other than tools we were taught with techniques such as different analytics, machine learning methods, dashboard, data visualisation, storytelling, data collection and cleansing.
# future plan
I am going to prusue another course this january in artificial intelligence as I am very interested in coding and different algorithm used in the machine learning. Further this course add to my skill set.Finally, after completing this course I will try to find in any organisation as data analyst.
